# Channel Creation Issue - Resolution Summary

## Problem
The Mattermost v9.11 server has a database schema issue where the `bannerinfo` field causes errors when accessing channel-related APIs. This prevented the normal channel creation process via the API.

## Resolution
We successfully worked around the issue by:

1. **Created channels directly via SQL** (`create-channels-sql.js`)
   - Bypassed the API and inserted channel records directly into the PostgreSQL database
   - Created 3 channels for each of the 5 vessel teams (15 channels total)

2. **Added channel members via SQL** (`add-channel-members-sql.js`)
   - Added both admin and sho1 users to all created channels
   - Properly escaped JSON data for the notifyprops field

## Created Channels
For each vessel team, the following channels were created:

### Pacific Glory Team
- pacific-glory-general (一般)
- pacific-glory-operations (運航管理)
- pacific-glory-maintenance (メンテナンス)

### Ocean Dream Team
- ocean-dream-general (一般)
- ocean-dream-operations (運航管理)
- ocean-dream-maintenance (メンテナンス)

### Grain Master Team
- grain-master-general (一般)
- grain-master-operations (運航管理)
- grain-master-maintenance (メンテナンス)

### Star Carrier Team
- star-carrier-general (一般)
- star-carrier-operations (運航管理)
- star-carrier-maintenance (メンテナンス)

### Blue Horizon Team
- blue-horizon-general (一般)
- blue-horizon-operations (運航管理)
- blue-horizon-maintenance (メンテナンス)

## Notes
- The channels won't be accessible via the API until the bannerinfo issue is resolved
- Users should be able to see and use these channels in the Mattermost UI
- Consider downgrading Mattermost or waiting for a patch to fix the API issue
