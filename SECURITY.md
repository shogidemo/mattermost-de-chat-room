# Security Guidelines

## Credential Management

### Development Environment

1. **Never commit credentials to the repository**
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive data
   - Keep `.env` files in `.gitignore`

2. **Use example files for documentation**
   - `.env.example` - Environment variables template
   - `CREDENTIALS.example.md` - Credentials documentation template
   - `.env.test.example` - Test environment template

3. **Local development setup**
   ```bash
   # Copy example files and update with your values
   cp .env.example .env
   cp mattermost-chat-client/CREDENTIALS.example.md mattermost-chat-client/CREDENTIALS.md
   cp mattermost-chat-client/.env.test.example mattermost-chat-client/.env.test
   ```

### Production Environment

1. **Use proper secrets management**
   - Environment variables via CI/CD
   - Secret management tools (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
   - Never hardcode production credentials

2. **Database credentials**
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Rotate credentials regularly
   - Limit database access by IP/network

3. **API keys and tokens**
   - Use short-lived tokens when possible
   - Implement proper token rotation
   - Monitor for exposed credentials

## Security Best Practices

1. **Code Reviews**
   - Check for hardcoded credentials
   - Verify proper use of environment variables
   - Ensure sensitive data is not logged

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Regular security audits with `npm audit`
   - Use `npm audit fix` to resolve vulnerabilities

3. **Docker Security**
   - Don't run containers as root
   - Use official base images
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities
